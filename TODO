[x] Friendly get/set text fns on CosmicEditor impl

BUGS INTRODUCED:

[ ] MultiStyle text is fully dead. Idk what I did to it :(

[ ] Cannot select text on Ui bundles sized by percentage
        Maybe intercept percentages and set as px on instantiation?
        Replace evaluate() with custom percent to px fn?
            Read into how evaluate() works

[ ] Window resizing broken
    Used to redraw on click, now redraws on scroll or drag?
    Now drag doesn't work either (tested on readonly, might be that)
    Either way redraw on resize would be nice.

BUGS SQUASHED:

[x] Font size has been changed somehow

[x] Cursor on readonly
