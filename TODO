[x] Friendly get/set text fns on CosmicEditor impl

BUGS INTRODUCED:

[ ] Not all text boxes want to be click-selectable
    Make utils.rs in examples; move click functions there.

BUGS SQUASHED:

[x] Font size has been changed somehow

[x] Cursor on readonly

[x] MultiStyle text is fully dead. Idk what I did to it :(

[x] Cannot select text on Ui bundles sized by percentage

[x] Window resizing broken
    Used to redraw on click, now redraws on scroll or drag?
    Now drag doesn't work either (tested on readonly, might be that)
      fixed by percentage-select fix
