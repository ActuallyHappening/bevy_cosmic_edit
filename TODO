[x] Friendly get/set text fns on CosmicEditor impl

BUGS INTRODUCED:

[ ] Window resizing broken
    Used to redraw on click, now redraws on scroll or drag?
    Now drag doesn't work either (tested on readonly, might be that)
    Either way redraw on resize would be nice.

BUGS SQUASHED:

[x] Font size has been changed somehow

[x] Cursor on readonly
