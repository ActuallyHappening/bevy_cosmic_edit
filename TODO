[x] Friendly get/set text fns on CosmicEditor impl

BUGS INTRODUCED:

[ ] Cursor on readonly
[ ] Window resizing broken
    Used to redraw on click, now redraws on scroll or drag?
    Now drag doesn't work either (tested on readonly, might be that)

BUGS SQUASHED:

[x] Font size has been changed somehow
